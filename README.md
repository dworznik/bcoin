# BCoin

**BCoin** is a bitcoin node which can act as an SPV node or a (semi-)fullnode.

## Install

```
$ npm install bcoin
```

## Example Usage

### Doing a full blockchain sync

``` js
var bcoin = require('bcoin');
var utils = bcoin.utils;

var pool = new bcoin.pool({
  // Number of peers to connect to
  size: 8,
  // Output debug messages
  debug: true,
  // We want a traditional full node sync
  type: 'full',
  // Use testnet
  network: 'testnet'
});

// Peer errors: they happen all the time.
pool.on('error', function(err) {
  utils.print('Error: %s', err.message);
});

// When a new block is added to the chain:
pool.on('block', function(block, peer) {
  // Give a progress report every 500 blocks
  if (pool.chain.height() % 500 === 0)
    utils.print('block=%s, height=%s', block.rhash, pool.chain.height());
});

// Start the get blocks sync
pool.startSync();
```

### Doing a fast SPV sync

``` js
var bcoin = require('bcoin');
var utils = bcoin.utils;
var fs = require('fs');

var pool = new bcoin.pool({
  // Number of peers to connect to
  size: 32,
  // Output debug messages
  debug: true,
  // We want an SPV sync using getheaders
  type: 'spv',
  // Use testnet
  network: 'testnet'
});

// Peer errors: they happen all the time.
pool.on('error', function(err) {
  utils.print('Error: %s', err.message);
});

// Instantiate an HD wallet with a serialized xprivkey
var wallet = new bcoin.wallet({
  hd: {
    xkey: process.env.XPRIVKEY || process.argv[2]
  }
});
utils.print('Opened wallet with address: %s', wallet.getAddress());

// Save our wallet for later
process.on('SIGINT', function() {
  fs.writeFileSync(
    process.env.HOME + '/my-wallet.json',
    JSON.stringify(wallet.toJSON()));
  process.exit(0);
});

// When a new block is added to the chain:
pool.on('block', function(block, peer) {
  // Give a progress report every 500 blocks
  if (pool.chain.height() % 500 === 0)
    utils.print('block=%s, height=%s', block.rhash, pool.chain.height());
});

// Watch for transactions pertaining to our wallet
pool.addWallet(wallet);

// Add watched transactions to our wallet's tx pool
pool.on('watched', function(tx, peer) {
  wallet.addTX(tx);
});

// Look for balance changes
wallet.on('balance', function() {
  utils.print('Wallet balance updated: %s', utils.btc(wallet.balance()));
});

// Start the getheaders sync
pool.startSync();
```

### Creating and sending a transaction

``` js
var bcoin = require('bcoin');
var utils = bcoin.utils;

// Create a pool in order to broadcast our transaction
var pool = bcoin.pool({
  size: 8,
  type: 'spv',
  network: 'testnet'
});

// Retrieve our fully synced wallet
var wallet = bcoin.wallet.fromJSON(require('./my-wallet.json'));
utils.print('Opened wallet with address: %s', wallet.getAddress());

// Create another wallet to send to
var receiver = bcoin.wallet();
utils.print('Created receiver wallet with address: %s', receiver.getAddress());

// Save our new wallet, lest we lose the funds
fs.writeFileSync(process.env.HOME + '/my-new-wallet.json',
  JSON.stringify(receiver.toJSON()));

// Create a transaction
var tx = bcoin.tx();

// Add an output, send some money to our new wallet
tx.output({
  address: receiver.getAddress(),
  // Every satoshi value in bcoin is
  // a big number, so we can convert
  // a BTC string to satoshis (big
  // number) by using utils.satoshi().
  // NOTE: BTC strings _must_ have
  // a decimal point.
  value: utils.satoshi('0.001')
});

// Fill the transaction inputs with the
// necessary unspents (hopefully we have them!).
tx.fillUnspent(
  wallet.unspent(),    // Our unspents to choose from
  wallet.getAddress(), // Our change address (warning: address re-use)
  null                 // We could put a hard fee here, but lets let bcoin figure it out
);

// Sign the transaction and place
// all signatures in necessary inputs
wallet.sign(tx);

// Make sure our transaction is valid.
if (!tx.verify())
  throw new Error('Our transaction did not verify!');

// Add our new TX to our wallets now
// that we know it is valid.
wallet.addTX(tx);
receiver.addTX(tx);

// Inspect our transaction before we send it.
utils.print('Sending transaction: %s', tx.rhash);
utils.print(tx);

// Tell our peers that we want to
// send a transaction across the network
pool.broadcast(tx)
  .on('ack', function(peer) {
    utils.print('Peer %s requested our transaction!', peer.host);
  })
  .on('reject', function(peer, details) {
    utils.print('Peer %s did not like our transaction (reason: %s).', peer.host, details.reason);
  });

// Watch for the transaction on the network
pool.watch(tx.hash());

// Wait to see our transaction on the network
pool.on('tx', function(ntx) {
  if (ntx.hash('hex') !== tx.hash('hex'))
    return;

  if (ntx.block)
    utils.print('Our tx was included in block %s (%d confirmations)', ntx.rblock, ntx.getConfirmations());
  else
    utils.print('Our tx is being propogated throughout the network!');

  // Add the network transaction to
  // our wallets to update the
  // confirmation status
  wallet.addTX(ntx);
  receiver.addTX(ntx);
});
```

### Multisig Transactions

Let's fabricate a 2-of-3 [escrow and dispute mediation][escrow] situation.

``` js
var bcoin = require('bcoin');
var utils = bcoin.utils;

var pool = bcoin.pool({
  size: 8,
  network: 'testnet'
});

var buyer = bcoin.wallet({
  type: 'scripthash',
  subtype: 'multisig',
  m: 2,
  n: 3
});

var seller = bcoin.wallet({
  type: 'scripthash',
  subtype: 'multisig',
  m: 2,
  n: 3
});

var mediator = bcoin.wallet({
  type: 'scripthash',
  subtype: 'multisig',
  m: 2,
  n: 3
});

buyer.addKey(seller.getPublicKey());
buyer.addKey(mediator.getPublicKey());

seller.addKey(buyer.getPublicKey());
seller.addKey(mediator.getPublicKey());

mediator.addKey(buyer.getPublicKey());
mediator.addKey(seller.getPublicKey());

// We should all have the same p2sh address
utils.assert(buyer.getScriptAddress() === seller.getScriptAddress());
utils.assert(buyer.getScriptAddress() === mediator.getScriptAddress());

utils.print('Created 2-of-3 wallet with address: %s', buyer.getScriptAddress());

// Create a fake coinbase for buyer to use as his funds
var coinbase = bcoin.tx().output(buyer.getKeyAddress(), utils.satoshi('50.0'));
buyer.addTX(coinbase);

// Now let's create a tx as the buyer.
// He wants to buy something from seller.
var btx = bcoin.tx();

// Send 25 BTC to the shared wallet
// to buy something from seller.
btx.output({
  address: buyer.getScriptAddress(),
  value: utils.satoshi('25.0')
});

// Fill the unspents and sign
buyer.fillUnspent(btx);
buyer.sign(btx);

// Buyer sends his funds to the 2-of-3 wallet
pool.broadcast(btx);

// Seller can now try to redeem the funds
seller.addTX(btx);

// Seller creates a new transaction
var stx = bcoin.tx();

// Seller wants to send the BTC to himself
stx.output({
  address: seller.getKeyAddress(),
  value: utils.satoshi('25.0')
    // Subtract the fee
    .sub(utils.satoshi('0.0001'))
    // Subtract the mediator's cut
    .sub(utils.satoshi('1.0'))
});

// Give the mediator a little something,
// since he's such a cool guy.
stx.output({
  address: mediator.getKeyAddress(),
  value: utils.satoshi('1.0')
});

// Add the buyer's utxo as the input
stx.input(btx, 0);

// Add _one_ signature to the tx
seller.sign(stx);

// The tx should not verify at this point
utils.assert(!stx.verify());

// Buyer/Scammer: Hey Mediator, I never got my thing.
// Mediator: That sucks. Let me talk to Seller.
// Seller: I gave Buyer the item.
// Here's the proof: [insert proof here],
// and here's my transaction: [stx.toRaw() here]
// Mediator: Cool, looks good. I'll sign it!
mediator.sign(stx);

// The tx should now verify.
utils.assert(stx.verify())

// Mediator broadcasts Seller's now
// fully-signed transaction. Seller
// gets money.
pool.broadcast(stx);
```

### Scripts

Bcoin has its own deserialized version of scripts to make them human-readable
and human-writable. For example, a standard pay-to-pubkey script would look
like:

``` js
tx.output({
  value: new bn(100000),
  script: [
    'dup',
    'hash160',
    hash, // Byte Array
    'equalverify',
    'checksig'
  ]
});
```

Opcodes are in the form of their symbolic names, in lowercase, with the `OP_`
prefixes removed. Pushdata ops are represented with Arrays.

The above script could be redeemed with:

``` js
tx2.input({
  out: { tx: tx, hash: tx.hash('hex'), index: 0 },
  seq: 0xffffffff,
  script: [
    signature, // Byte Array
    publicKey  // Byte Array
  ]
});
```

Executing a script by itself is also possible:

``` js
var stack = [];
bcoin.script.execute([[1], 'dup'], stack);
console.log(stack);

Output:
[[1], [1]]
```

#### Pushdata OPs

Note that with bcoins deserialized script format, you do not get to decide
pushdata on ops. Bcoin will always serialize to `minimaldata` format scripts in
terms of `OP_PUSHDATA0-OP_PUSHDATA4`.

`OP_0` is represented with an empty array (which is appropriate because this is
what gets pushed onto the stack). While `OP_1-16` are actually represented with
numbers. `OP_1NEGATE` is just '1negate'.

So a script making use of all pushdata ops would look like:

``` js
script: [
  [],                                // OP_0 / OP_FALSE
  1,                                 // OP_1 / OP_TRUE
  2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,        // OP_2-10
  11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,            // OP_11-16
  '1negate',                         // OP_1NEGATE
  new Array(0x4b)),                  // PUSHDATA0 (direct push)
  new Array(0xff)),                  // PUSHDATA1
  new Array(0xffff)),                // PUSHDATA2
  new Array(0xffffffff))             // PUSHDATA4
];
```

##### Custom Scripts

Bcoin will allow you to use custom P2SH scripts, but it's up to you to
redeem/sign it property.

``` js
var wallet = bcoin.wallet({
  redeem: [
    1,
    '1add',
    'equal'
  ]
});
console.log(wallet.getScriptAddress());
var tx1 = bcoin.tx().output(wallet.getScriptAddress(), new bn(100000));
```

Which would be redeemed with:

``` js
tx2.input({
  out: { tx: tx1, hash: tx1.hash('hex'), index: 0 },
  script: [
    2,
    // Redeem script:
    wallet.getScript()
  ]
});
```

### Big Numbers

Bitcoin deals with really big numbers on a regular basis. Javascript Numbers
lose precision after 53 bits. It is absolutely necessary to use big numbers
when dealing with satoshi values.

``` js
var bcoin = require('bcoin');
var bn = bcoin.bn;

...

// Add an output with 100,000 satoshis as a value.
tx.output(wallet.getKeyAddress(), new bn(100000));
```

To make this easier to deal with, bcoin has two helper functions: `utils.btc()`
and `utils.satoshi()`.

``` js
// Convert a BTC string to Satoshis
var value = utils.satoshi('1.123');
console.log(value);
// Convert back to a BTC string
console.log(utils.btc(value));
```

Output:

``` js
<BN: 6b18fe0>
1.123
```

Note that BTC strings are identified by having a decimal point. They _must_
have a decimal point in order to be converted to satoshis by `utils.satoshi()`.

This will work:

``` js
var value = utils.satoshi('1.0');
```

This will __not__ work:

``` js
var value = utils.satoshi('1');
```

### Endianness

Everything in the bitcoin protocol is little-endian, including block hashes and
txids. Bcoin doesn't try to change this at all. If you're outputing a tx hash,
you will get the little-endian version.

You will not be able to find this hash on a blockchain explorer:

``` js
console.log(tx.hash('hex'));
```

The byte order must be reversed:

``` js
console.log(utils.revHex(tx.hash('hex')));
```

To make this easier, both tx and block objects have a quick `rhash` property:

``` js
// Output BE hashes as hex string - you will
// be able to find these on a blockchain explorer.
console.log(tx.rhash);
console.log(block.rhash);
```

### Arrays vs. Buffers

Every piece of binary data in bcoin that is user-facing in bcoin is an Array of
bytes. For example, `block.hash()` with no encoding passed in will return a
byte array.  Bcoin does use Buffers behind the scenes to speed up parsing of
blocks and transactions coming in through the network, but every piece of data
a programmer using bcoin will deal with is going to be a byte array.

### Saving transactions to a wallet

Most of the time, you won't need all transactions in the blockchain if you're
only building a wallet. When a transaction comes in pertaining to your wallet,
it's best to called `wallet.addTX(tx)` and save the wallet afterwards.

``` js
pool.on('watched', function(tx) {
  wallet.addTX(tx);
});

pool.on('full', function() {
  fs.writeFileSync(
    process.env.HOME + '/wallet.json',
    JSON.stringify(wallet.toJSON()));
});
```

### Saving the blockchain

At the moment, bcoin does not save any full blocks or make any assumptions
about how the programmer wants to do it. It only saves the blockchain (block
headers and chainwork). The programmer simply needs to hook into block events
and save the blocks.

``` js
pool.on('block', function(block) {
  // A simple key-value store:
  db.save(block.hash('hex'), utils.toHex(block.render()), function(err) {
    if (err)
      return console.error(err.message);
    console.log('Block %s saved.', block.rhash);
    // Could also save transactions individually here for quick lookups
  });
});
```

#### Handling Blockchain Forks

Bcoin handles blockchain forks like an SPV client. If it sees an alternate tip,
it will reset to the last non-forked block and kill the current peer while
emitting a `fork` event (see Pool events). It will repeat this process until
the network eventually chooses the best chain.

Bcoin essentially backs off and waits to see which fork wins. This means bcoin
plays no part in protecting the network by helping choose the best chain
according to the chainwork.

Note that this may _still_ cause an issue with transactions that are already
saved and considered confirmed. It's best to hook into the fork event and
remove all confirmed transactions you may have saved in your database.

``` js
pool.on('fork', function(tip1, tip2) {
  // Keep deleting everything until
  // the fork is resolved:
  db.get(tip1, function(err, block) {
    block.txs.forEach(function(tx) {
      db.remove(tx.hash('hex'));
    });
  });
  db.get(tip2, function(err, block) {
    block.txs.forEach(function(tx) {
      db.remove(tx.hash('hex'));
    });
  });
  db.remove(tip1);
  db.remove(tip2);
});
```

#### ChainDB (from Object)

The blockchain database. Stores `ChainBlock` entries in a serialized binary
format. The same format as block headers (80 bytes), except an extra uint256 is
included at the end for chainwork, making each entry 112 bytes.

The ChainDB uses synchronous reads and asynchronous writes by default.

ChainDB caches the past `majorityWindow` blocks (1001 on main), or
`powDiffInterval` (2016 on main) blocks if `network.powAllowMinDifficulty` is
enabled. This is to speed up target calculation and `isSuperMajority` checks.

##### Events:

- None.

##### Methods:

- Inherits all from Object.
- __count()__ - Number of total records (different from chain height).
- __get(height)__ - Get ChainBlock entry synchronously.
- __getAsync(height, callback)__ - Get ChainBlock entry asynchronously (used
  for initial blockchain load).
- __save(entry, [callback])__ - Save ChainBlock entry asynchronously.
- __saveSync(entry)__ - Save ChainBlock entry synchronously.
- __has(height)__ - Returns true if ChainDB has a block at this height.

#### Pool (from EventEmitter)

A pool of peers. The heart and soul of bcoin's network activity.

Usage: `bcoin.pool(options)`

Pool will connect to one `loader` peer and `options.size` number of `block`
peers. The `loader` peer is for `getblocks` or `getheaders` (as well as
`getdata`, but only on a traditional `getblocks` sync). The `block` peers are
used for `getdata` (on a non-traditional sync) as well as for broadcasting
blocks/txes and receiving broadcasted blocks/txes.

The pool object will handle DoS attempts, label peers as misbehaving and ban
them if necessary. If the pool does not receive an verack packet from a peer
after a specified amount of time, the peer will be killed and a new one will be
found. If the pool does not receive a block or inv packet in a specified amount
of time, the loader peer will be killed and a new one will be found.

The pool object currently does not listen on a socket. It cannot accept
connections (it can only connect to peers). It also doesn't maintain a mempool.
In this way, the bcoin pool object is a "selfish" node. It does not help
propogate data throughout the network.

- __network__ - Which builtin network to use. Can be `main`, `testnet`, or
  `regtest`.

  `fullNode=true` respectively).
- __headers__ - Force use of `getheaders` for blockchain download depending on
  boolean value.
- __multiplePeers__ - Force downloading of blocks from multiple peers depending
  on value (__NOTE:__ setting this to `true` for a `getblocks` sync is a very
  bad idea).
- __relay__ - Relay value in `version` packet. See BIP-37 for details.
- __createSocket(port, host)__ - Callback to create a socket. Must return a
  node-like socket.
- __seeds__ - List of initial seeds (array of strings in the format of
  `{ipv4/host}:{port}` or `[{ipv6}]:port`). Port will be set to the default
  network port if not present.

  on the loader peer (which sends another `getblocks`/`getheaders`) (default:
  5000).

  requests (default: 250).
- __rangeWindow__ - Disabled.
- __lwm__ - Low watermark queue-length boundary to hit before more
  `getheaders`/`getblocks` requests are attempted (default: 4000).
- __hwm__ - High watermark queue-length boundary to cross before bcoin will
  prevent any further `getheaders`/`getblocks` requests and wait until the low
  watermark has been hit (default: 16000).
- __maxRetries__ - amount of times to retry scheduled requests on peer before
  destroying the peer (default: 42).
- __requestTimeout__ - timeout before retrying a request (default: 10000).
- __invTimeout__ - Amount of time before removing objects from the broadcasted
  `inv` list (default: 60000).

                }

- __scriptOutput(index/output, options)__ - Compile an output script for the
  output based on the same options `output()` handles.
- __signatureHash(index/input, s, type)__ - Return the to-be-signed hash of the
  transaction for the desired input. Must pass in previous output subscript as
  `s`, as well as the sighash type (number or string of `all`, `none`, or
  `single`).
- __verify([index], [force], [flags])__ - Execute and verify the desired input
  script. If no index is passed in, all inputs will be verified. `verify()`
  will not verify TXes already included in blocks, set `force=true` to force
  verification. `flags` can be any of the bitcoind script flags in lowercase,
  i.e. `{ cleanstack: false }`. They are all enabled by default. Returns true
  if verification succeeded.
- __isCoinbase()__ - Returns true if TX is a coinbase.
- __maxSize()__ - Estimate the size of the transaction in bytes (works before
  input scripts are compiled and signed). Useful for fee calculation.
- __getUnspent(unspent, changeAddress, [fee])__ - Determine which unspents to
  use from `unspent` (an array of possible unspents, usually returned by
  `wallet.unspent()`). Calculates the fee and chooses unspents based on the
  total value required for the transaction. A hard `fee` can be passed in
  (satoshis/big number) which will skip the fee calculation. Calculates the
  necessary change. Returns an object in the form of:

        {
          inputs: [array in inputs to add],
          change: [change in satoshis (big number)],
          cost: [total cost minus fee in satoshis (big number)],
          fee: [fee for transaction in satoshis (big number)],
          total: [total cost including fee in satoshis (big number)],
          kb: [total kb for fee calculation]
        }

  `inputs` will be `null` if not enough funds were available.
  __NOTE:__ `getUnspent()` should only be called once all outputs have been added.
- __fillUnspent(unspent, [changeAddress], [fee])__ - Calls `getUnspent()` and
  adds the created inputs to the transaction. Adds a change output if
  necessary. Returns the same result value as `getUnspent()`. __NOTE:__ Should
  only be called once all outputs have been added.
- __getFee()__ - Returns the fee for transaction.
- __funds(side)__ - Returns the total funds for a side of the transaction
  `'in'` or `'out'`.
- __setLockTime(lock)__ - Sets a locktime for the transaction. Will set the
  nSequences accordingly.
- __increaseFee(fee)__ - Increase fee to a hard fee. Opts transaction in for
  replace-by-fee. __NOTE:__ Transaction must be rescripted and resigned before
  broadcasting.
- __fill(wallet/txpool/object)__ - Fills all the transaction's inputs with the
  appropriate previous outputs using the available transactions in a wallet,
  txpool, or an object with txids as its keys and txs as its values.
- __isFull()__ - Returns true if the TX has all previous output references.
- __isFinal(height, ts)__ - Mimics the bitcoind `IsFinalTx()` function. Checks
  the locktime and input sequences. Returns true or false.
- __getSigops([scripthash], [accurate])__ - Count sigops in transaction. Set
  `scripthash=true` to count redeem script sigops. Set `accurate=true` for
  accurate counting instead of legacy counting.
- __isStandard()__ - Mimics bitcoind's `IsStandardTx()` function.
- __isStandardInputs()__ - Mimics bitcoind's `IsStandardInputs()` function.
- __getPriority()__ - Calculate transaction priority based on input age.
  Returns a big number.
- __isFree()__ - Determines whether transaction needs a fee or not based on
  priority and size. Returns true if tx needs no fee.
- __getHeight()__ - Returns the height of the block TX was included in, similar
  to `GetDepthInMainChain()`. Returns `-1` if no block is found.
- __getConfirmations()__ - Returns number of confirmations.
- __getValue()__ - Returns total value on the output side.
- __toJSON()__ - Return serialized TX in bcoin JSON format.
- __toRaw()__ - Returns serialized TX in standard bitcoin binary format.
